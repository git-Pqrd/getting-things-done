## getting things done 
#Here is my idea of a productivity app
#Made it to learn techno also to be able to show 
#But most importantly might be usefull for me


The idea is to implement the steps of the book

Having a trusted basket and being able to define the steps needed to change outcome.

#front-end 
Javascript React-redux

#back-end
python django-rest-framework

#Auth 
JWT

#Main functionalities
1. Being able to collect "stuff"
2. Decide which cat stuff are in 
3. Define steps to take
4. Track progress on steps
5. Store actions for jurisprudence
